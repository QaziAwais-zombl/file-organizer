**Downloads Organizer**

Tired of a messy Downloads folder? This Python desktop app automatically organizes files into categories like Images, Videos, Documents, Audio, Archives, Executables, and more.

Built with Tkinter for a simple GUI and Python’s file handling libraries for automation.

**✨ Features**

🗂 Auto-sorting by file type (customizable categories)

🖥 Simple GUI (choose any folder, not just Downloads)

🔄 Duplicate handling → automatically renames duplicates like file(1).txt

📝 Activity log → shows exactly what happened during sorting

🚨 Error handling for permissions, already-existing files, etc.




**🚀 How It Works**


Select your target folder (default is usually your Downloads).

Click Organize Downloads.

Files get moved into subfolders like:

/Images

/Videos

/Documents

/Others (for uncategorized files)
